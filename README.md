How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I make my programs maintainable by separating responsibilities into different files and functions so that each part of the code has one clear purpose. For example, the CRUD Python module from Project One made it easy to connect the MongoDB database to my dashboard in Project Two without rewriting code. This module handled all the database operations (create, read, update, delete) and could be reused in other projects that use MongoDB. Working this way made the dashboard code simpler, more organized, and easier to update in the future, so it was less stressful to make changes or add new features. I also focus on writing clear variable names and adding comments so that anyone reading the code can easily understand its logic. Consistent formatting and modular design make the project adaptable, so I could reuse the same module or expand it later with minimal changes.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I start by analyzing the requirements and breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts so that I can focus on solving one thing at a time. For the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I looked at how the data needed to be structured in MongoDB first, so the rest of the project would be easier to build. Then I designed the CRUD module to handle communication between the database and the dashboard, so the front end didn’t need to know the database details. Finally, I built and tested the dashboard widgets to display and filter the data so users could interact with it easily. Compared to earlier assignments, this project required me to think more about how real users would experience the system, so I spent more time refining how data flows between components. In the future, I would continue to use this step-by-step approach so I can build reliable, flexible systems that meet client needs.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems by designing systems that make data more useful and accessible, so people and organizations can make better decisions. My work on the Grazioso Salvare dashboard showed how technology can make real-world processes faster and more efficient, so the company can focus on rescuing and training dogs instead of sorting through spreadsheets :). The dashboard helps them identify which animals are ready for training or placement more quickly, so it directly supports their mission. This type of work matters because it shows how computer science connects logic, creativity, and purpose. Computer scientists create tools that help people save time, reduce mistakes, and improve lives — so our work has a lasting impact on both technology and the communities that use it.
